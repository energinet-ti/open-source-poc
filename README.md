# Open Source POC

Welcome to **open-source-poc** â€“ a simple Proof of Concept project to show how open-source contribution would work between **Transmission System Operators (TSOs)**!

Your mission is simple: submit a message in a text file. Bonus points for adding company logo to Contributors sections.

## ðŸ’¡ Why This Exists

This repository serves as a **proof of concept** to demonstrate how open-source collaboration between different TSO could work.

In a sector where interoperability, transparency, and collaboration are increasingly critical, open-source can provide a common platform for TSOs to:

- Share simple, standardized code contributions
- Establish version-controlled public collaboration
- Reduce duplication by building on each other's work
- Create a transparent foundation for industry-wide tools or standards

By using a basic "Hello, World!" format, this project lowers the barrier to entry and showcases the **workflow** of contributing code across organizational boundaries â€” including for TSOs exploring open collaboration.

This is just the beginning. From here, more complex proofs of concept can evolve, powered by the same shared infrastructure.
