# Contributing to open-source-poc

Thank you for your interest in contributing to this open-source proof of concept!

This repository is a demonstration of how open-source collaboration can work between **Transmission System Operators (TSOs)** in a lightweight, transparent, and version-controlled way.

---

## üìå Goal

To show how TSOs can:
- Contribute to shared tools and workflows
- Build trust through transparent code collaboration
- Lower barriers to joint innovation using open standards

---

## üß© What to Contribute

Your contribution should be:
- A **plain text file** with a simple message (e.g., a greeting from your organization)
- Optionally include your **company logo** in the PR to be added to the Contributors section of the README

You may personalize the message (e.g., "Hello from Nordic TSO!" or "Greetings from RTE").

---

## üìÅ File Naming

Use a file name like:

```
message-[your-org].txt
```

Example:
- `message-rte.txt`
- `message-nordic-tso.txt`

Place it in the message folder of the repository.
